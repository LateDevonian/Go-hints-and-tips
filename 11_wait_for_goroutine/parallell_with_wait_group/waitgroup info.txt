a wait group is a message passing facility toat signals a waiting 
goroutine when it's safe to proceed.
tell wait group when you want it to wait for something
signal whwn the thing is done
needs to know a) number of things it's waiting for
b) when the thing is done.
increment a with wg.Add and when completed signal with wg.Done.
wg.Wait blocks until all tasks that are added are done.

call wg.Done inside a goroutine

so there is a schedular for a goroutine but this might exceute them.
anytime a loop excecutes a goroutine, make sure variables the goroutine uses are not changed
by the loop. so make copies of the variouables within the loop.
